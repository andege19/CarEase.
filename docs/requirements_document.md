Investors focus on growth, ROI, and market differentiation.



SECTION 3: Data Gathering \& Market Research as Inputs to Requirements

Inputs
The requirements are informed by extensive market research, data gathering, and analysis of industry trends, customer pain points, and competitor offerings.

Market Research Details

The car servicing industry in Kenya is fragmented, with most providers relying on manual processes.

Urbanization and vehicle ownership are rising, yet service accessibility remains limited, especially outside major cities.

Traditional service centers often lack standardized pricing, leading to customer distrust and dissatisfaction.

Environmental sustainability is a growing concern, with high water usage and chemical waste from conventional car washes

Data Collection Techniques and Summary

Primary Research:

Interviews: Conducted with car owners, service providers, and industry experts to understand pain points and expectations.

Questionnaires: Distributed to a broad demographic to gather quantitative data on frequency of car servicing, preferred service types, booking challenges, and willingness to pay for convenience and eco-friendly options (see Google Forms data).

Field Observations: Visits to car washes and garages to observe workflows, wait times, and customer interactions.

Workshops: Collaborative sessions with stakeholders to brainstorm features and validate requirements.

Secondary Research:

Market Reports: Analysis of the automotive servicing sector in Kenya and global trends in digital transformation.

Academic Articles: Insights into the impact of digital platforms on service delivery and customer satisfaction.

Competitor Analysis: Review of local and international platforms (e.g., YourMechanic, Fixter) to identify best practices and gaps.

Reviews: Study of customer feedback on existing services to identify recurring issues and desired features

Key findings from the data include:

73% of car owners spend more than two hours at service stations for routine maintenance.

92% of respondents reported being overcharged at least once.

There is high demand for mobile, on-demand, and eco-friendly car servicing options.
